Fighter Game
Overview
Fighter Game is a classic 2D arcade-style game built using VB.NET. In this game, the player controls a fighter aircraft, navigating through waves of enemy ships. The game is designed with a simple objective: survive and destroy as many enemy ships as possible. The player has three bullet lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost.

Score Tracking: The game tracks the player's score, which increases with each enemy destroyed.
